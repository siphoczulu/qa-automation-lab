# QA Automation Lab (Playwright + API + CI)

Goal: Become job-ready in QA Automation/SDET by building proof projects.

## Stack
- Playwright (UI automation)
- API testing (Postman → later code)
- GitHub Actions (CI)

## January 2026 Targets
### Week 1 - Foundation (Completed Jan 8)
- [x] Install Playwright and run tests locally
- [x] Write first UI test (TodoMVC)
- [x] Write first API test (JSONPlaceholder)
- [x] Add GitHub Actions CI and get first green run

### Week 2 — Coverage + Structure (Starts Jan 12)

- [ ] Add UI test #2 (toggle complete OR delete)
- [ ] Add Playwright config (playwright.config.ts)
- [ ] Add API negative test
- [ ] Improve reporting (HTML report artifact review)

### Proof I will ship
- Green CI run screenshot or badge
- Short notes per day (what I built + what I learned)
- Clean commit history

## Why this exists
I’m building consistent daily reps: 60 minutes QA per day minimum.
