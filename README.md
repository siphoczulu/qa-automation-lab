# QA Automation Lab (Playwright + API + CI)

Goal: Become job-ready in QA Automation/SDET by building proof projects.

## Stack
- Playwright (UI automation)
- API testing (Postman → later code)
- GitHub Actions (CI)

## January 2026 Targets
### Week 1 (Jan 7–Jan 11)
- [ ] Install Playwright and run the starter test locally
- [ ] Write 1–3 UI tests (basic navigation + assertions)
- [ ] Create a Postman collection (5 requests with assertions)
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions to run tests on push (first CI green run)

### Proof I will ship
- Green CI run screenshot or badge
- Short notes per day (what I built + what I learned)
- Clean commit history

## Why this exists
I’m building consistent daily reps: 60 minutes QA per day minimum.
